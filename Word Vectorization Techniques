##Part A: Count Vectorizer

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# List of sentences
sentences = [
    "I love machine learning.",
    "Machine learning is fascinating.",
    "I love data science and machine learning."
]

# Initialize CountVectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the sentences
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(sentences)

feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

word_count_matrix = X.toarray()

print("Feature Names (Words):")
print(feature_names)

print("\nWord Count Matrix:")
print(word_count_matrix)


##Part B: TF-IDF Vectorizer

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# List of sentences/documents
documents = [
    "Natural language processing is exciting.",
    "Text analysis is crucial in data science.",
    "Deep learning models improve NLP tasks."
]

# Initialize TfidfVectorizer
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

# Fit and transform the documents
X_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

feature_names = tfidf_vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()

tfidf_matrix = X_tfidf.toarray()

print("Feature Names (Words):")
print(feature_names)

print("\nTF-IDF Matrix:")
print(tfidf_matrix)
